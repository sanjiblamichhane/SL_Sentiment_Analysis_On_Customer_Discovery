The following were considered in framing the business problem into a machine learning problem.
## 1.	How does the business identify success in the project?
- identifying target customers,
- identifying major problems faced by customers to be solved by our product,
- minimizing the cost of product

### Mapping Business Metric -> ML Metrics
- data collection
- sentiment analysis
- cost analysis

## 2.	What are the inputs, and what are the desired outputs?
- Input: collected data (cleaned and transformed) from various sources,
- What do we want our model to predict?
    - type of industry ( aquaculture, marines, tourism, etc.) that has historically spent on such products.
    - likelihood of purchase (given a solution, how likely is a particular customer group to purchase our product.)

## 3.	What are the data sources and is labeled data available?
- direct interviews conducted by Marketing team,
- public datasets
- web scrapping to source external data
- narrowed down scope of the project to do customer discovery.

## 4.	Are there proxy metrics that may be useful to the business?
- direct interviews and niche customer segment

## 5.	Start simple and build complexity over time.
- perform EDA, sentiment analysis

## 6.	Consider criteria such as model risk if they are relevant to your industry.
- present results to stakeholders.
