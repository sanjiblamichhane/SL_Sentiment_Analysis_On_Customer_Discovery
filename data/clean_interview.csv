9/20/2021,,Marine Biologist Shellfish Management,In-Person,"Jennifer is in charge of permits, regulations and issues for Aquaculture farmers in New York, mostly for oysters and shellfish. To issue the permit the farmers have to apply through the town to choose spots that were already mapped, it costs about $155 to get the permit from state. Samples are collected through the FDA national shellfish sanitation and needs to approve to send people to sign to collect sensors to collect oxygen and acidity. To prevent birds, they use spikes, pinwheels on buoys. GIS website shows location of all the farms, farmers also use buoys with permit number and lights to see the buoys at night. She would like to keep track of the number of fish in the water to have more accurate information to give relief aid or monitor accidents that cause sudden loss. The data is done manually but they would like more accurate inventory monitoring. Check how many sold and raised. They would like a digital system to track the amount of oyster and fish. The regulators need accurate information about the inventory because with inaccurate information they can't give out government funds to farmers who suffered loss due to covid/other events. "
9/9/2021,,President CEO,In-Person,"Their farm is located in Maryland Chesapeake Bay, they raise small oysters known as spat, raised on the bottom of the sea. They are looking for an anti-theft system that will be able to support remote operations with minimal cell coverage since they're in a remote location with poor cell coverage. "
9/9/2021,,Electronics Design Technician,Video Conference,"They use cables to transmit power and data, he is looking for accurate, efficient, low power consumption means of acoustic data transmission. He was concerned about reliability, power, and data volume restrictions. The remoteness of stations and the constant need for divers or large boats for swapping out components is not logistically feasible nor cost effective for multiple stations that are deployed year round. They use hardwired moorings for power and data and enough internal memory and power onboard the sensor as backup. Overcoming those challenges is needed, the use of inductive modems are not always reliable either."
9/9/2021,,Owner,Video Conference,"They raised Tilapia fish indoor, in a controlled environment and saved 90% of water by recirculating the water. Oxygen, Temperature and water recirculation were all controlled and controlled the density manually to observe the density of the fish, the biomass has not been automated yet. If they want to monitor the density accurately along with the number, size and distance of fish maintained in the tank, they will need an automated system."
9/9/2021,,Owner,Video Conference,"She took eggs indoor and hatched them controlling the oxygen and temperature and density of the fish  indoors, after 2-5 days before taking the fish outdoors. Therefore the survival rate increased from 13% to 25%. She would like to have an automotive aeration system so that she can operate the farm remotely."
9/9/2021,,Owner,In-Person,"The fish was raised as bait for other fishermen, not for food. The fish was raised on pond water, and used the water on his garden and the water contains all the best nutrients for the plants. He doesn't recycle the water in case there are any diseases in the water. He also raised the fish in cages, where the fish eggs are attached to the cage however, predators are a main issue since the pond is open it is vulnerable. "
9/9/2021,,Owner,Video Conference,"Eagle and birds took 70% of the stock, he was raising the fish in the raceway and put 10,000 fingerlings and only raised 3,000 fish. He would need something to monitor the fish stock. He also mentioned that we covered the raceway with the net, but the small fish was still successfully eaten by the birds. "
9/9/2021,,Policy Director,In-Person,"Explained that it is important to look into improving the biomass of fish, if our device can help farmers to monitor biomass accurately. "
9/9/2021,,Owner,Video Conference,"They use a side scan sonar to detect where fish population is underwater. Male paddle. fish i s worth $100 while females are $1000 since they also harvest for caviar. The farm is monocultured, about 300 acres and when harvesting they only use a max of 3 nets since the fish are very large. They are shipped by truck, cought by 2 fishers. On avaerage about 40 fish are caught, the lakes are far away so the amount spent is about $800 daily. Water qaulity is not the main issue since they choose very healthy waters, the issue is finding a location where the fish are gathering in large amounts to make the best profit and increase to more than 40 fish a catch. The fish are also harvested after 10 years and the population consists of an even number of males and females, there is no mix up with the age of the fish."
9/9/2021,,Farm Owner,In-Person,"They raise trout and Bass, they have 10tanks with 9,000 gallons each. They monitor for bacteria, ammonia and nitrate. The black bass are raised in ponds. They make their own filtration system with brum filters and solid waste is used out in the fields. They use a pathogen vaccine on their fish to prevent disease. They also remove duck weed by hand."
9/9/2021,,Owner of Trout Business ,In-Person,"Fish are raised in 'raceways' or tanks, there are 13 different ponds. The eggs are harvested after two years and fish are fed once a day by workers. They need to maintain good aeration. Solids in the tanks get vacuumed by a trash pump and there are about 30,000 to 40,000 fish in each tank. "

8/26/2021,,ECSGA Executive Director,Video Conference,"Bob described how he keeps baby shellfish in heavy cages at depths of 12 -20 meters (shallow water) and harvest them once they are mature. However, thieves and poachers use dredges to steal oysters on the ocean bottom that are cage free. The thief he encountered would steal 4 days a week before dawn and made a profit of $100 a day. They were interested in a detection system to track when a boat is trying to harvest buy the speed of the boat and be able to have a high resolution to detect the boat's license. Most of the farms are small have have 4-5 employees, so they can't afford systems over $5,000. He also mentioned that we monitors his own water quality since the FDA only monitors it every 6 months, and the Coast Guards are not always there to protect against theft.  Radar is also discouraged in his farm due to it being a disturbance with airplanes. He had referred us to more aquaculture farmers who are looking for a standard monitoring system."
8/23/2021,,Seafood Safety and Technology Specialist,In Person,"Described Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, which uses zero emissions by using fish waste which get filtered by a second organism to feed a third organism (cultivation system). They need cost-effective technological solutions to address the open ocean conditions, including currents, swell, waves, seafloor depth, and such issues as shipping routes and marine mammal migration routes, our technology can help them."

8/21/2021,,Assistant Dive Safety Officer ,Phone,"Oysters and Coral reefs in the Harbor help each other grow and prevent against destruction from Hurricanes. They send out Divers to take pictures of the ecosystems health and use a rope to pull Divers back to shore, however it can get tangled with sea weed and our technology can help track them wirelessly and enable Divers to communicate back while underwater. "
